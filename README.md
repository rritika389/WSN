#Fault detection in wireless sensor networks using autoencoder classifier.
# We propose a fault detection algorithm based on an autoencoder-based classification model.
Unlike traditional neural networks, autoencoders have equal numbers of neurons in the input and output layers, facilitating fault detection by comparing input and output values.
We evaluate the proposed algorithm against existing approaches using three key parameters: fault detection accuracy, false alarm rate, and false positive rate.
Our simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in detecting faults such as spike, fixed bias, gain, and out-of-bounds faults within the network.
The proposed Autoencoder architecture incorporates essential components such as the weight matrix, W^[h] , and the bias vector, b^[h] , in the hidden layer.
These parameters are vital for transforming the input data into the lower-dimensional space
To introduce non-linearity and facilitate complex mappings within the hidden layer, an activation function, f^[h] is applied.
Encoding process involves capturing and condensing the essential features and characteristics of the input data, enabling efficient representation.
The decoder component of the autoencoder is responsible for reconstructing the encoded data back to its original dimensions, generating a reconstruction vector.
To optimize the performance of the autoencoder, the model iteratively adjusts its parameters, including the weights (W) and biases (b), with the objective of minimizing the reconstruction error.
The error between the input data and the reconstructed output in the autoencoder is quantified using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.
To enhance the accuracy of the reconstruction process, ensuring that the output closely approximates the original input data.
The proposed algorithm was rigorously evaluated using three essential performance metrics: accuracy, false alarm rate, and false positive rate.
Accuracy, measures the percentage of correctly classified SNs, encompassing both faulty and non-faulty nodes, out of the total number of SNs.
The false alarm rate is a crucial metric that indicates the ratio of false alarms to the total number of non-faulty SNs. 
Similarly, the false positive rate represents the ratio of false positives, where non-faulty SNs are mistakenly identified as faulty, to the total number of non-faulty SNs.
